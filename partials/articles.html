    <p>Canada’s household debt load took a notable step back from near-record levels in the first quarter of the year, as the trifecta of tougher mortgage rules, rising interest rates and accelerating incomes delivered a dose of relief that policy makers have long been looking for.</p>
    <p>Statistics Canada reported on Thursday that the ratio of household credit-market debt to disposable income – the most closely watched measure of Canadians’ debt burden – fell for the second straight quarter to a two-year low of 168 per cent, from 169.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. It was the biggest quarter-to-quarter decline in Statscan’s 28-year record of the measure and comes after Ottawa’s new mortgage-borrowing restrictions went into effect on Jan. 1.</p>
    <p>The impact of the new rules – as well as rising mortgage rates as a result of three quarter-percentage-point rate increases by the Bank of Canada since last July, the most recent coming in mid-January – was evident in mortgage borrowing, which declined 13 per cent from the fourth quarter to $13.7-billion, the lowest level in nearly four years. Statscan said the slowdown reflected a 17-per-cent drop in residential resales in the quarter, as the new mortgage rules and higher interest rates took hold. The rise in home prices has also slowed dramatically: The Teranet-National Bank national house price index, released on Wednesday, showed year-over-year growth of a tame 4.5 per cent in May, the slowest pace since the end of 2013.</p>
    <p>“Macroprudential measures and the cooling of Canada’s housing market are having the desired effect on household’s balance sheets,” said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, improving growth in Canadians’ paycheques is delivering a boost to the other side of the debt-to-income equation. Statscan said that while overall household debts still crept up 0.3 per cent from the fourth quarter, disposable income rose a brisk 1.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>“We may finally be at a turning point,” said Bank of Montreal economic analyst Priscilla Thiagamoorthy in a research note.</p>
    <p>“The [Bank of Canada] will look favourably on that shift, even as elevated household debt remains a vulnerability,” she said.</p>
    <p>Canada’s high household debt loads have been a concern at the Bank of Canada for years, as it has worried that a sudden economic shock could put a lot of Canadian families in trouble, posing a danger both to the economy and to the country’s financial stability. The central bank’s Financial System Review, a major report released this week, listed household debts as the No. 1 vulnerability to the financial system.</p>
    <p>In that report, the Bank of Canada noted that the situation had improved, citing the slowing debt growth and “improvements in credit quality” stemming from the rise in interest rates and the tightening of mortgage regulations. “But even as conditions slowly improve, the sheer size of the outstanding debt means that the vulnerability will likely persist at an elevated level for some time,” it cautioned.</p>
    <p>“Developments in the last two quarters are unlikely to change the conversation about household indebtedness in Canada entirely, though they are enough to alter its tone,” Royal Bank’s Mr. Hogue said. “With growth in both mortgage and non-mortgage debt slowing, debt metrics should continue to improve in the near term.” However, with the Bank of Canada poised to increase interest rates further this year in light of an economy running at close to full capacity and inflationary pressures rising, Canadians who are carrying high debts face growing pressures on the cost of carrying those debt loads.</p>
    <p>Canadians’ debt-service ratio – which measures combined principal and interest payment obligations as a proportion of disposable income – held steady at 13.9 per cent in the first quarter, as incomes and interest rates both rose. But Statscan noted that in mortgages – which account for about two-thirds of household debt – total interest payments rose 3.7 per cent in the quarter, even as principle payments dipped 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>“In a rising interest-rate environment, much of the focus will also be on how Canadian households will manage their debt service costs,” Mr. Hogue said. “We expect that [the debt-service ratio] will come under upward pressure in the period ahead. In our view, this will be a key factor restraining household spending growth this year. It will also be an element keeping the Bank of Canada cautious about raising rates.”</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Statscan also reported that Canada’s total household net worth slipped 0.2 per cent in the quarter, the first decrease since the third quarter of 2015. It blamed the dip mainly on declines in stock markets. “That shouldn’t be a big worry at this stage, considering the degree to which households’ assets (both financial and non-financial) have increased over the past several years,” Mr. Hogue said.</p>

    <h1>The Truth about Genetically Modified Food</h1>

    <p>Robert Goldberg sags into his desk chair and gestures at the air. “Frankenstein monsters, things crawling out of the lab,” he says. “This the most depressing thing I've ever dealt with.”</p>
    <p>Goldberg, a plant molecular biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, is not battling psychosis. He is expressing despair at the relentless need to confront what he sees as bogus fears over the health risks of genetically modified (GM) crops. Particularly frustrating to him, he says, is that this debate should have ended decades ago, when researchers produced a stream of exonerating evidence: “Today we're facing the same objections we faced 40 years ago.”</p>
    <p>Across campus, David Williams, a cellular biologist who specializes in vision, has the opposite complaint. “A lot of naive science has been involved in pushing this technology,” he says. “Thirty years ago we didn't know that when you throw any gene into a different genome, the genome reacts to it. But now anyone in this field knows the genome is not a static environment. Inserted genes can be transformed by several different means, and it can happen generations later.” The result, he insists, could very well be potentially toxic plants slipping through testing.</p>
    <p>Williams concedes that he is among a tiny minority of biologists raising sharp questions about the safety of GM crops. But he says this is only because the field of plant molecular biology is protecting its interests. Funding, much of it from the companies that sell GM seeds, heavily favors researchers who are exploring ways to further the use of genetic modification in agriculture. He says that biologists who point out health or other risks associated with GM crops—who merely report or defend experimental findings that imply there may be risks—find themselves the focus of vicious attacks on their credibility, which leads scientists who see problems with GM foods to keep quiet.</p>
    <p>Whether Williams is right or wrong, one thing is undeniable: despite overwhelming evidence that GM crops are safe to eat, the debate over their use continues to rage, and in some parts of the world, it is growing ever louder. Skeptics would argue that this contentiousness is a good thing—that we cannot be too cautious when tinkering with the genetic basis of the world's food supply. To researchers such as Goldberg, however, the persistence of fears about GM foods is nothing short of exasperating. “In spite of hundreds of millions of genetic experiments involving every type of organism on earth,” he says, “and people eating billions of meals without a problem, we've gone back to being ignorant.”</p>
    <p>So who is right: advocates of GM or critics? When we look carefully at the evidence for both sides and weigh the risks and benefits, we find a surprisingly clear path out of this dilemma.</p>

    <h1>Wind energy is supposed to fight climate change. But climate change is fighting back</h1>

    <p>Climate change is affecting wind energy’s potential to provide power, diminishing a renewable energy source that scientists and policymakers are counting on to replace fossil fuels, according to two scientific studies.</p>
    <p>The world is turning more and more to renewable sources of energy – wind, solar power, and in some cases energy from flowing water – to fight climate change. But what if climate change itself alters the distribution of wind, or sunlight falling on the Earth’s surface, or river flows, and so changes or even shrinks the potential of these energy sources?</p>
    <p>The studies suggest that, at least for wind energy, that is not only happening – at least in some key locations – but that it could grow worse.</p>
    <p>“Renewables, including wind, are an important part of many nations’ and even states’ overall strategies for reducing greenhouse emissions,” said Kristopher Karnauskas, a researcher at the University of Colorado, and first author of one of the studies. “So it’s important that we fully understand how the potential efficacy of that mitigation strategy may be changing concurrently with the problem itself. We can’t assume that the baseline wind energy resource is a constant.”</p>
    <p>Why would wind energy potential change because of climate change? At the most fundamental level, winds are driven by the unequal distribution of the sun’s energy across the surface of the Earth, which in turn creates regions of different atmospheric pressure. Wind then flows from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. Those installing wind turbines try to place them in spots where that flow tends to be particularly strong.</p>
    <p>But climate change is also distributing energy unevenly across the planet. In particular, land surfaces are warming up more rapidly than are ocean surfaces, even as the Arctic is warming up much more rapidly than the northern hemisphere’s middle latitudes.</p>
